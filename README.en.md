# DeepWrite

> A local-first AI writing agent workbench for creators.

DeepWrite brings models, prompts, writing skills, reference materials, manuscripts, and tools together in one desktop app. Agents can understand the context of your current work, help develop characters, plots, outlines, and prose, edit real documents through controlled tools, and hand every change to you for review.

## Highlights

- **Three-pane writing workspace**: manage projects and context, collaborate with agents, and edit real content in one view.
- **Workflow-specific agents**: organize distinct responsibilities around characters, plots, outlines, manuscripts, and section writing.
- **Reviewable manuscript edits**: inspect every diff before it is saved, preventing silent overwrites by agents.
- **Local-first data**: store works as `deepwrite.json` and UTF-8 Markdown files that remain usable with Git, sync drives, and other text tools.
- **Bring your own models**: add your preferred model services and switch models or thinking levels by agent or task.
- **Material libraries, skill libraries, and sub-agents**: bind the right context and capabilities to each work, or assemble teams for complex tasks.
- **Style learning**: analyze reference text in stages and reuse its writing traits in future work.

## How It Works

### Keep the whole writing process in view

Inspired by the Codex workflow, DeepWrite uses a clear three-pane layout for the surfaces you use most:

- Left: works, chapters, material libraries, skill libraries, and common actions
- Middle: agent chat, reasoning, tool execution, and edit suggestions
- Right: characters, plots, outlines, manuscripts, materials, or skill content

When you switch between writing stages or chapters, DeepWrite switches to the matching agent and context. Browsing materials and skills does not interrupt the current manuscript, and chapters can be opened quickly in separate tabs.

### Work with specialized writing agents

Short-form creation includes several agents with focused responsibilities:

- Character Agent: design characters, relationships, motivations, and character arcs
- Plot Agent: plan the main storyline, opening hooks, conflicts, turns, and endings
- Outline Agent: turn characters and plot into an executable section outline
- Manuscript Expert: oversee structure, review drafts, and polish the final text
- Section Writer: write around the current chapter while keeping plot, characters, and voice consistent

Each agent can have its own system prompt, welcome shortcuts, and model. Short-form and screenplay agents can also have configurable resource access. Long-form stages share access to settings, plot, manuscript, and continuity records while retaining per-agent controls for readable material and skill types. Main agents can also lead sub-agent teams.

### Review before writing to disk

Agents never silently replace your text. Each write first produces a diff so you can inspect additions and deletions, then accept or reject the proposal. Only accepted changes are saved locally. If another operation has already updated the manuscript, DeepWrite preserves the newer version instead of overwriting it.

### Manage local works and knowledge bases

DeepWrite supports:

- Creating or opening local works
- Managing characters, plots, outlines, and multiple manuscript sections
- Creating material and skill libraries with Markdown entries
- Binding selected libraries, skills, or resource groups to a work
- Importing legacy book ZIP archives into the current folder structure
- Restoring unsaved drafts and recent agent sessions automatically

Your data stays in open local file formats instead of being locked inside the app.

### Bring your own models

You can add your own API services in Model Settings. DeepWrite currently supports:

- OpenAI Completions
- OpenAI Responses
- Anthropic Messages
- Google Generative AI

Model keys are never exposed to the renderer. Each model can have a default thinking level, and you can switch models by task during a conversation.

### Learn and reuse writing styles

Style learning analyzes reference text in stages, extracts reusable writing traits, and applies the results to later creation. Its models and prompts can be configured separately in Settings.

### Access the workspace in a browser (Web service mode)

Enable **Settings → General → Web service → Browser access** to start a loopback Web service on `127.0.0.1` (port `8742` by default). Open the displayed address in a browser on the same computer to use the same full writing workspace; the browser and desktop client share local works and model configuration.

- The service binds only to the local loopback address and has no built-in authentication in this version. Do not forward the port to the network or Internet.
- Stop the service before changing its port. If the port is occupied, choose another port after disabling the service.
- In embedded desktop mode, operations that require native file dialogs run on the desktop client. Standalone mode has no Electron dialogs; use `--workspace-dir` to select the workspace, and native file import/export operations are unavailable.

To run the web service without opening an Electron window:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm web
```

The entry accepts `--port`, `--data-dir`, and `--workspace-dir`, for example:

```bash
pnpm web -- --port 8742 --data-dir ./deepwrite-web-data --workspace-dir ./workspace
```

Standalone mode uses a Node process and `child_process.fork` for the Core, Agent, and Tool utilities. It does not depend on Electron. The default data directory is `DeepWrite Web` under the platform configuration directory; localhost access does not require a secret. Standalone uses its own Node AES-GCM credential store rather than Electron's system store; set `DEEPWRITE_WEB_SECRET` to keep standalone model and marketplace credentials portable across machines or data directories.

### Docker deployment

The repository includes `Dockerfile.web` and `docker-compose.web.yml`. On YC8G or another Linux Docker host:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.web.yml up -d --build
docker compose -f docker-compose.web.yml ps
```

Compose maps the container to host `127.0.0.1:8742` by default. From a local computer, create an SSH tunnel and open `http://localhost:8742/`:

```bash
ssh -p <ssh-port> -L 8742:127.0.0.1:8742 <user>@<yc8g-host>
```

Do not map this unauthenticated service directly to the public Internet. Add authentication and HTTPS in a reverse proxy if public access is required.

## Installation and Setup

### Use an installer

Go to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/swjybky/deepwrite/releases) and download the test installer matching your OS and processor:

| Platform | Installer |
| --- | --- |
| Windows x64 | `DeepWrite-<version>-win-x64-test.exe` |
| macOS Apple Silicon | `DeepWrite-<version>-mac-arm64-test.dmg` |
| macOS Intel | `DeepWrite-<version>-mac-x64-test.dmg` |

On Windows, run the `.exe` and follow the installer.

On macOS, open the `.dmg` and drag DeepWrite into Applications. Current test builds use ad-hoc signing and are not notarized by Apple. Downloads received through a browser, WeChat, or similar channels may trigger a macOS security warning. Confirm that you trust the source, then right-click the app and choose Open, or allow it under System Settings → Privacy & Security.

After the first launch:

1. Choose a local workspace directory.
2. Add an API service in Model Settings and test the connection.
3. Create a work, or open an existing DeepWrite project folder.
4. Create and bind material or skill libraries as needed.

### Run from source

Requirements:

- Node.js 24 or later
- pnpm 11 or later
- Windows x64, or macOS Apple Silicon / Intel

```bash
git clone https://github.com/swjybky/deepwrite.git
cd deepwrite
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Common development commands:

```bash
pnpm dev       # Start the desktop development environment
pnpm build     # Build the production app
pnpm verify    # Run formatting, type, boundary, test, and build checks
```

## Build Test Installers

Test installers must be built on their target platform from the repository root:

```bash
pnpm pack:test             # All test packages supported by the current host
pnpm pack:test:win         # Windows x64
pnpm pack:test:mac:arm64   # macOS Apple Silicon
pnpm pack:test:mac:x64     # macOS Intel
pnpm pack:test:mac         # Both macOS architectures
```

Artifacts are written to `apps/desktop/release/`. The packaging flow runs the full verification suite and a production build before generating and validating installers.

DeepWrite uses a multi-process Electron architecture: the Renderer handles the UI, Main manages windows and secure IPC, the Core Utility handles local project I/O, the Agent Utility runs models and agents, and the Tool Utility provides a bounded surface for controlled tool execution.
